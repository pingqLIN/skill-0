## 🎯 Project Goal

Design and evaluate an **extremely lightweight, real-time security scanner** for the OpenClaw C++ game engine that:

1. **Leverages skill-0's semantic decomposition framework** for instruction analysis
2. **Detects security hazards** in real-time during development and runtime
3. **Minimizes performance overhead** (<5% impact)
4. **Integrates seamlessly** with existing C++ game engine workflows

## 📊 Key Findings Summary

### Target Project: OpenClaw
- **Type:** Open-source C++ game engine (Captain Claw platformer reimplementation)
- **Language:** C++14/17
- **Dependencies:** SDL2, Box2D, TinyXML, libpng, zlib
- **Primary Risks:** Memory safety (60-70% of C++ vulnerabilities), dependency vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks

### Comparative Analysis

| Solution Type | Examples | Strengths | Weaknesses | Fit for OpenClaw |
|--------------|----------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **Static Analysis** | SonarQube, Snyk, CodeQL | Comprehensive, CI/CD integration | No runtime detection, batch mode | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **AST/Semantic** | Clang Static Analyzer, Semantic SAST | Deep C++ understanding, context-aware | Complex setup, resource intensive | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Runtime Anti-Cheat** | Real American Security, Napse.ac | Real-time detection, memory forensics | Game-specific, expensive | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **skill-0 Based** | **This Project** | Lightweight, semantic decomposition, extensible | New approach, requires validation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

### Feasibility Verdict: ✅ **HIGHLY FEASIBLE**

**Confidence Level:** 85%

**Rationale:**
1. ✅ skill-0 already has proven security scanning infrastructure (SEC001-SEC009 rules)
2. ✅ Semantic decomposition naturally maps to C++ instruction analysis
3. ✅ Existing tools (Clang AST, Tree-sitter) can integrate with skill-0 framework
4. ✅ OpenClaw's open-source nature enables comprehensive testing
5. ⚠️ Challenge: Adapting skill-0 (designed for AI Skills/MCP) to native C++ code

## 🔍 What Makes This Approach Unique?

### Traditional SAST vs. skill-0 Semantic Scanner

**Traditional SAST (e.g., SonarQube):**
```
Source Code → Regex Patterns → Vulnerabilities
```
- Fast but shallow
- High false positive rate
- Limited context understanding

**skill-0 Semantic Scanner:**
```
Source Code → AST Parser → Ternary Classification → Actions/Rules/Directives → Risk Assessment
```
- Context-aware through semantic decomposition
- Separates what code *does* (Actions), how it *decides* (Rules), and what it *means* (Directives)
- Extensible pattern library
- Integration with vector search for similarity detection

### Example: Buffer Overflow Detection

**Traditional Pattern:**
```regex
strcpy|memcpy|sprintf
```
❌ High false positives (many safe usages)

**skill-0 Decomposition:**
```json
{
  "action": {
    "id": "a_001",
    "name": "Unsafe Memory Copy",
    "action_type": "transform",
    "deterministic": true,
    "risk_indicators": ["no_bounds_check", "user_input"]
  },
  "rule": {
    "id": "r_001", 
    "name": "Destination Size Verified",
    "condition_type": "validation",
    "output": "boolean"
  },
  "directive": {
    "id": "d_001",
    "directive_type": "constraint",
    "description": "All memory operations must validate destination size"
  }
}
```
✅ Context-aware: Only flags when bounds checking is absent

## 📈 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Scan Latency** | <100ms per file | Real-time feedback during development |
| **Memory Overhead** | <50MB | Minimal impact on development environment |
| **Runtime Impact** | <5% | Acceptable for continuous monitoring |
| **False Positive Rate** | <15% | Better than typical SAST (~30-40%) |
| **Detection Coverage** | >70% | Match or exceed commercial tools |

## 🛠️ Technology Stack Recommendation

1. **Parser:** Clang LibTooling or Tree-sitter (C++)
2. **Decomposition Engine:** skill-0 Python framework (existing)
3. **Pattern Storage:** SQLite + sqlite-vec (existing)
4. **Integration:** CLI tool + IDE plugin (VS Code/CLion)
5. **Runtime Monitor:** Optional eBPF-based instrumentation
